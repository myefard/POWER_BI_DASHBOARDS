# üß† Power BI Office Space Utilization Dashboard
## About This Project
This Power BI project was developed as part of a space utilization analytics initiative.  
It demonstrates end-to-end dashboard design ‚Äî from data preparation to visualization and storytelling.

## üìä Introduction
![Dashboard Overview](assets/SC1.jpg)


In today‚Äôs hybrid work environment, managing and optimizing **office space utilization** is a growing challenge for organizations. Decision-makers need accurate, real-time insights into how spaces are used, which business units are under- or over-utilizing areas, and how workplace patterns evolve over time.

Recognizing this need, I designed and developed a **Power BI dashboard** that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics for space utilization. The dashboard provides a clear and dynamic view of how different departments perform in terms of occupancy, cost efficiency, and employee presence rates ‚Äî helping leaders make informed, data-driven decisions.

## üß© Project Objectives
The goal of this project was to create a **data-driven monitoring system** that:
- Tracks and analyzes **space utilization KPIs** across multiple business units  
- Allows **interactive filtering** by time, business unit, or location  
- Highlights **historical trends and variances**  
- Enables **data-driven recommendations** for space optimization and cost reduction  

This Power BI dashboard serves as both a **management tool** and an **analytical framework**, helping corporate real estate teams identify inefficiencies and predict future needs.

## ‚ùó Problem Statement
Traditional reporting tools offered only static, one-dimensional insights that quickly became outdated.  
The main challenges were:
- Fragmented data sources and inconsistent formats  
- Manual report generation with no ability to drill down  
- Lack of visibility into **historical performance** and **trend analysis**  
- Inability to compare multiple **business units or time periods** dynamically  

My mission was to **transform static data into an interactive, automated visualization system** that updates in real time and adapts to user selections.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1. **Data Collection and Preparation**
Collected data from internal databases, spreadsheets, and occupancy systems.  
Performed **data cleaning**, normalization, and validation in Power Query to ensure consistency across all metrics (e.g., cost per RSF, occupancy rate, employee attendance).

### 2. **Data Modeling**
Created a **relational data model** that connected multiple tables ‚Äî including location, business unit, KPIs, and historical data ‚Äî ensuring one-to-many relationships were properly configured for accurate DAX measures.

### 3. **DAX Development**
Developed several **DAX formulas** to calculate:
- Occupancy and vacancy rates  
- Cost and RSF  related Metrics and KPIs
- Employee-in-office percentages Metrics and KPIs
- Dynamic chart units, titles and KPI labels  

This required advanced use of `SELECTEDVALUE`, `SWITCH`, and `CALCULATE` to make metrics respond instantly to slicer interactions.

> **Example:**  
> The `2-PG1 CHART units` measure dynamically adjusts the suffix (%, $, RSF) displayed in chart titles depending on the selected KPI.

### 4. **Visualization and Design**
Designed the dashboard using **Power BI‚Äôs modern visual storytelling approach**, focusing on:
- Clean layout and minimal design  
- Consistent color schemes for readability  
- KPI cards for executive summary  
- Interactive slicers for time, location, and business unit filters  
- Drill-through pages for detailed department-level analysis  



### 5. **Interactivity & Dynamic Titles**
Implemented **dynamic page titles and metrics** that change based on user selection ‚Äî providing clear context for what data is being displayed.

### 6. **Historical Trend Analysis**
Included historical data views to analyze occupancy rate, cost trends, and headcount distribution over time, helping stakeholders track changes and forecast needs.

## üß† What I Did
This project was a complete end-to-end data visualization development process that included:
- Designed **data architecture and relationships**  
- Created and cleaned datasets using **Power Query**  
- Wrote **DAX measures** for dynamic KPIs and visual behavior  
- Developed **custom visuals** and layout design  
- Implemented **interactive slicers**, **buttons**, and **bookmarks** for intuitive navigation  
- Validated calculations and tested interactivity with real user scenarios

## üìö What I Learned
Throughout this project, I deepened my understanding of how **data visualization impacts decision-making** and learned several technical and analytical lessons:

### Technical Lessons
- How to **optimize DAX performance** with calculated columns vs. measures  
- Best practices for **data modeling** (star schema, normalization, and relationships)  
- Importance of **context transition** in DAX (especially when using `CALCULATE`)  
- How to build **scalable dashboards** that can adapt to additional KPIs or datasets  

### Business & Design Lessons
- The importance of **user-centric design** ‚Äî dashboards must be intuitive, not just technically advanced  
- How clear data storytelling drives better engagement from business users  
- How dynamic insights can transform a reporting tool into a **strategic decision-making platform**
